# MCP Tutorial and Index Routes

I've successfully added two new routes to your MCP server:

## 1. `get_mcp_tutorial` - Comprehensive Tutorial

**Usage:**
```python
# Get tutorial overview
get_mcp_tutorial()

# Get specific section
get_mcp_tutorial(section="getting_started")
```

**Available Sections:**
- `getting_started` - Quick introduction and basic workflow
- `scene_creation` - Creating and managing animation scenes
- `objects_and_animations` - Adding visual elements and animations
- `timeline_presets` - Using pre-built animation sequences
- `rendering` - Rendering options and output formats
- `api_integration` - Connecting to external APIs
- `advanced_features` - Script preservation, batch operations, and tips

## 2. `get_tools_index` - Tool Discovery

**Usage:**
```python
# Get all tools organized by category
get_tools_index()

# Get tools from specific category
get_tools_index(category="animation")

# Get tools without examples
get_tools_index(include_examples=False)
```

**Categories:**
- `scene_management` - Scene creation and management
- `object_creation` - Adding text and shapes
- `animation` - Animation controls
- `timeline_presets` - Preset management
- `rendering` - Render operations
- `api_discovery` - API integration tools
- `utility` - Helper tools
- `documentation` - Tutorial and index tools

## Implementation Details

The implementation includes:
- Comprehensive tutorial content covering all aspects of the MCP interface
- Dynamic tool index that categorizes all available tools
- Usage examples for each tool (when enabled)
- Error handling for invalid sections/categories

Both routes are now available through the MCP interface and can be accessed through Claude Desktop or any MCP client.
