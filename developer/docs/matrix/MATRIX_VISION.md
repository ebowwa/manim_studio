## üèóÔ∏è Core Infrastructure for the Matrix

### 1. **State Management & World Simulation**
The actual simulation engine that maintains world coherence:

- **Network synchronization protocol** for multiplayer
- **Undo/redo system** with memory efficiency
- **Version migration system** for backwards compatibility

### 8. **Query System**
Find anything in your universe:

- **Spatial queries** - "What's near X?"
- **Temporal queries** - "What happened at time T?"
- **Semantic queries** - "All red objects"
- **Relationship queries** - "Connected components"
- **Performance profiling queries** - "What's slow?"

### 9. **Debugging Infrastructure**
See inside the matrix:

- **Visual debugger overlays** for runtime inspection
- **Performance flame graphs** for optimization
- **State inspection tools** for deep debugging
