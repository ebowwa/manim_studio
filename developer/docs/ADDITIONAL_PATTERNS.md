# Additional Patterns and Techniques from xiaoxiae's Videos

Beyond the initial analysis, here are more valuable patterns extracted from the repository:

## 1. **Custom Animation Classes**

### MoveAndFadeThereBack
- Moves object along path while fading out and back in
- Creates smooth "ghost" movement effects
- Perfect for showing transformations or alternatives

### Increment Animation
- Animates number changes with upward movement
- Changes the actual text/number at midpoint
- Creates satisfying counting effects

### Wiggle Animation
- Complex wiggle with scaling and rotation
- Configurable number of wiggles and intensity
- Great for drawing attention to objects

### Custom Rate Functions
```python
ROBOT_RATE_FUNC = lambda x: rush_into(x * 2) if x < 0.5 else rush_into((1 - x) * 2)
MINERAL_RATE_FUNC = lambda x: 0 if x < 0.5 else slow_into((x - 0.5) * 4) if x < 0.75 else slow_into((1 - x) * 4)
```

    AnimationGroup(
        animation1,
        animation2,
        lag_ratio=0.2,
    ),
    AnimationGroup(
        animation3,
        animation4,
        lag_ratio=0.5,
    ),
    lag_ratio=0.75,
)
```

### Succession with Wait
```python
Succession(
    Wait(0.5),
    Write(text),
    Wait(0.5),
    FadeOut(text)
)
```

### Complex Timing Patterns
- Delayed flash functions for sorting networks
