## Hollywood-Military Entertainment Complex

### Scale and Scope

The relationship between Hollywood and the U.S. military represents one of the most extensive propaganda operations in peacetime history:

- **2,500+ Productions**: The Pentagon and CIA have exercised direct editorial control over more than 2,500 films and television shows
- **Institutional Infrastructure**: DoD Entertainment Media Unit and dedicated military service public affairs offices in Hollywood
- **Economic Leverage**: Studios dependent on access to military equipment and locations

### Control Mechanisms

#### 1. Script Approval Process
- **Mandatory Submission**: Scripts must be vetted by military officials for equipment/location access
- **Content Restrictions ("Showstoppers")**:
  - American war crimes
  - Friendly fire incidents
  - Fragging of officers
  - Military sexual assault
  - Suicide
  - Any content that could damage recruitment or public image

#### 2. Economic Coercion
- **Subsidized Access**: Military hardware provided at fraction of market cost
- **Top Gun Example**: Paramount paid only $1.1 million for warplanes and aircraft carrier
- **Dependency Creation**: "Get the cooperation of the military, or forget about making the picture"

#### 3. Narrative Shaping
- **Image Rehabilitation**: Top Gun "completed rehabilitation of military's image" post-Vietnam
- **Key Talking Points**: Military officials ensure insertion of recruitment and foreign policy messages
- **Self-Censorship**: Writers craft scripts to please military from the beginning

### Recruitment Integration

#### Top Gun Case Study

- **Actual Impact**: 8% increase in overall Navy enlistment in 1986
- **Modern Continuation**: Air Force recruitment ads before Top Gun: Maverick screenings

### Propaganda Techniques

1. **Heroic Framing**: Military personnel portrayed as unambiguous heroes
2. **Technology Fetishization**: Military hardware as exciting, powerful, desirable
3. **Threat Amplification**: Enemies portrayed as existential threats requiring military response
4. **Consequence Minimization**: Downplaying civilian casualties, PTSD, moral injuries
