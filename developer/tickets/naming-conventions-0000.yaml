  Analysis of how the project name "manim_studio" is used across the codebase
  in its various forms and establishing guidelines for consistent usage.

findings:
  usage_statistics:
    manim_studio: 354  # snake_case - Python package name
    manim-studio: 39   # kebab-case - CLI commands
    ManimStudio: 9     # PascalCase - Class names
    "Manim Studio": 84 # Title case - Human-readable text

  usage_patterns:
    manim_studio:
      - purpose: "Python package and module naming"
      - locations:
        - "setup.py package name"
        - "All Python import statements"
        - "Module file paths"
        - "Internal configuration references"
      - example: "from manim_studio.core import SceneBuilder"
    
    manim-studio:
      - purpose: "Command-line interface and external tools"
      - locations:
        - "CLI entry point in setup.py"
        - "Command examples in documentation"
        - "Discord community URL"
        - "Logger names in MCP servers"
      - example: "manim-studio config.yaml --preview"
    
    ManimStudio:
      - purpose: "Class naming convention"
      - locations:
        - "Server class names (ManimStudioServer)"
        - "Social media handles (@ManimStudio)"
      - example: "class ManimStudioServer:"
    
    "Manim Studio":
      - purpose: "Human-readable display text"
      - locations:
        - "README headers and descriptions"
        - "UI text in animations"
        - "Documentation titles"
        - "Comments and docstrings"
      - example: "title = Text('Manim Studio v2.0')"

guidelines:
  - rule: "Use snake_case (manim_studio) for all Python code"
    reason: "PEP 8 compliance and Python convention"
    
  - rule: "Use kebab-case (manim-studio) for CLI commands"
    reason: "Unix command convention"
    
  - rule: "Use PascalCase (ManimStudio) for class names only"
    reason: "Python class naming convention"
    
  - rule: "Use title case (Manim Studio) for user-facing text"
    reason: "Better readability in documentation and UI"

implementation_notes:
  - "Current usage is already well-organized and follows best practices"
  - "No major refactoring needed, just maintain consistency"
  - "Consider adding a style guide to the developer documentation"

tracking_tool:
  script_name: "track_project_name.sh"
  location: "/Users/ebowwa/apps/manim_studio/track_project_name.sh"
  purpose: "Automated tracking of all project name variations across the codebase"
  features:
    - "Searches for all naming variations (snake_case, kebab-case, PascalCase, Title Case)"
    - "Generates detailed report in project_name_mentions.txt"
    - "Shows occurrence counts and file locations"
    - "Lists files with most mentions"
    - "Excludes binary files and common directories (.git, node_modules, etc.)"
  usage: "./track_project_name.sh"
  output_file: "project_name_mentions.txt"
