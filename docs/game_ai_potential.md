# Manim Studio for Video Game AI

## Current Capabilities

Manim Studio is a professional animation framework with sophisticated timeline and layering systems that could be adapted for video game AI applications.

### Key Features for Game AI

- **Timeline System**: Multi-layered timeline with keyframes and interpolation
- **Configuration-Driven**: YAML/JSON configs for non-programmer animation creation
- **Layer Management**: Z-ordering, visibility, blend modes
- **70+ Effects**: Particles, transitions, morphing
- **Interpolation Types**: Linear, easing, spring physics
- **Event System**: Timeline markers and region triggers
