# 3D Asset Support Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the technical roadmap for adding 3D asset loading support (GLB, OBJ, STL) to Manim Studio.

## Current State
- ✅ Manim has comprehensive 3D rendering capabilities
- ✅ Asset manager system is highly extensible 
- ✅ Scene builder supports plugin-based object creation
- ✅ OpenGL pipeline ready for 3D meshes
- ❌ No external 3D model loading capabilities

## Technical Architecture

### Core Files Requiring Modification

#### 1. Dependencies (`setup.py`)
```python
install_requires=[
    # existing dependencies...
    "trimesh>=3.15.0",      # Universal 3D loader
    "pygltf2>=1.15.0",      # Advanced GLB support
]
```

#### 2. Asset Manager (`src/manim_studio/core/asset_manager.py`)
**Extensions needed:**
- Add `models` directory to `asset_dirs`
- Implement `load_3d_model()` method with caching
- Format-specific loaders: `_load_glb()`, `_load_obj()`, `_load_stl()`

**API Design:**
```python
def load_3d_model(self, name: str, scale: float = 1.0, cache: bool = True) -> ThreeDVMobject:
    """Load a 3D model asset (GLB, OBJ, STL)."""
    # Cache key generation
    # Format detection and routing
    # Material/texture processing
    # Return ThreeDVMobject
```

#### 3. Scene Builder (`src/manim_studio/core/scene_builder.py`)
**Extensions needed:**
- Add `3d_model` object type support
- Implement `_create_3d_model()` method
- Material parameter processing
- Transform/positioning integration

## Configuration Examples

### Basic 3D Object
```yaml
objects:
  spaceship:
    type: 3d_model
    asset: "spaceship.glb"
    params:
      scale: 2.0
      position: [0, 0, 0]
      rotation: [0, 45, 0]
```

### Advanced Material Override
```yaml
objects:
  robot:
    type: 3d_model
    asset: "robot.obj"
    params:
      scale: 1.5
      position: [2, 0, -1]
      material:
        color: "#ff6b6b"
        metallic: 0.8
        roughness: 0.2
        emission: "#ffffff"
```

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: File Format Complexity
**Solution:** Use trimesh as primary loader - handles GLB/OBJ/STL with unified API

### Challenge 2: Performance with Large Models
**Solutions:**
- Aggressive model caching
- LOD system for distant objects
- Background loading for startup optimization
- Mesh simplification options

### Challenge 3: Material Pipeline Integration
**Solutions:**
- Create material abstraction layer
- Map GLB PBR materials to Manim rendering
- Texture atlas generation for performance
- Material parameter overrides in config

### Challenge 4: Animation Support
**Solutions:**
- Extend timeline system for skeletal animations
- Morph target interpolation
- Custom keyframe definition system
- Animation blending capabilities

## Dependencies Analysis

### Required Libraries
- **trimesh**: Universal 3D format loader, mesh processing
- **pygltf2**: Advanced GLB/GLTF parsing with material support
- **numpy**: Already included, used for mesh math

### Optional Libraries
- **pyassimp**: Additional format support (FBX, DAE, etc.)
- **PIL**: Already included, texture processing
- **scipy**: Mesh optimization algorithms

## Compatibility Considerations

### Manim Version Support
- Minimum: Manim 0.17.3 (current requirement)
- Target: Latest stable Manim version
- 3D features: Use existing ThreeDVMobject, ThreeDScene

### Python Version Support
- Maintain current requirement: Python >=3.7
- All selected libraries support this range

### Platform Support
- Windows: Full support via pip packages
- macOS: Full support via pip packages  
- Linux: Full support via pip packages

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Asset loading for each format (GLB, OBJ, STL)
- [ ] Cache functionality
- [ ] Error handling (missing files, corrupt models)
- [ ] Material extraction and processing

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Scene builder 3D object creation
- [ ] Animation timeline integration
- [ ] Layer manager 3D handling
- [ ] Configuration parsing

- [ ] Cache efficiency metrics
- [ ] Rendering performance impact

## Success Metrics

### Functionality Goals
- [ ] Support GLB, OBJ, STL formats
- [ ] Material/texture preservation
- [ ] Animation support (skeletal + morph targets)
- [ ] Configuration-driven workflow

### Performance Goals
- [ ] <2s load time for typical models (<10MB)
- [ ] <100MB memory overhead for loaded assets
- [ ] Cache hit rate >80% during development
- [ ] No rendering FPS degradation for simple scenes

### Developer Experience Goals

- [ ] Comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Example scenes covering common use cases

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Complex GLB animations**: May require significant Manim timeline extensions
- **Performance with large models**: Could impact real-time preview

### Medium Risk  
- **Material compatibility**: PBR → Manim material mapping complexity
- **Memory management**: Large textures/meshes could cause issues

### Low Risk
- **Basic model loading**: Well-established libraries available
- **File format support**: Trimesh handles most edge cases

## Future Considerations

### Potential Extensions

- [ ] Procedural mesh generation tools
- [ ] Physics simulation integration
- [ ] VR/AR rendering pipeline support

### Community Features
- [ ] Model marketplace integration
- [ ] Community asset sharing
- [ ] Format conversion tools
- [ ] Optimization recommendations

## Conclusion

The Manim Studio codebase is exceptionally well-positioned for 3D asset support. The modular architecture, existing 3D capabilities, and extensible configuration system make this a **high-feasibility enhancement** that would significantly expand the framework's capabilities.

**Recommended approach:** Incremental implementation starting with Phase 1 (basic loading) to validate the architecture, followed by progressive feature additions.

**Total estimated effort:** 7-12 weeks for comprehensive 3D asset system.
